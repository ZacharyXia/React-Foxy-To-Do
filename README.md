# Foxy To-Do

Foxy To-Do is a simple React-based To-do manager with rich text support.
This project is based on the [todo_react_app](https://github.com/javascriptbear/todo_react_app/) repository.

## Features

- **Create Tasks**: Users can easily create new tasks by providing a title and summary.
- **Edit Tasks**: Each task can be edited by clicking on the edit icon, which opens a text editor with rich text support.
- **Delete Tasks**: Unwanted tasks can be removed from the list with a single click on the delete icon.
- **Dark Mode**: The application supports a dark mode, which can be toggled with a convenient button for improved visibility in low-light conditions.
- **Persistent Data**: Task data is stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that your tasks are not lost even if the application is refreshed or closed.
